								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SOUTH ASIA, November 21, 2018 — Rupaya ($RUPX) which develops a world-class blockchain based payment platform for South Asia, announced today the launch of its newly renovated website. This newly redesigned website offers quick and easy access to essential information and features that offers a more comprehensive understanding of the Project&#8217;s innovative blockchain and cryptocurrency payment platform and related services. The website also has a newly developed investor section along with vastly improved areas for general news, leadership, wallet downloads and project governance information.</p>
<p>The new website has a clean uncluttered design, improved functionality and enhanced rich content focused on the Project&#8217;s mission to provide South Asia with the very best blockchain based payment platform possible. The new website goes live today, November 18, 2018 and is located at the same address: <a href="httpss://rupx.io/">httpss://rupx.io/</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very excited about our new website redesign and launch and the robust information it provides for users, investors, partners and media to better understand Rupaya&#8217;s best-in-breed blockchain payments technology,&#8221; said Aasim Khan, Rupaya Founder and Lead Developer. &#8220;We believe that this new site will allow our visitors to have an informative experience as we continue to grow and increase our market presence.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SOUTH ASIA, May 20, 2018 — Rupaya ($RUPX) today announced it is launching a major marketing initiative beginning next week using 380,000 RUPX, which were released from a community approved Governance proposal on May 13, 2018. This will start the beginning of Rupaya’s main 2018 marketing campaign aimed at raising awareness for the project.</p>
<p>In early 2018 Rupaya released an updated desktop wallet, kicked-off community governance, launched on several new exchanges, and partnered with SatoWallet on a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>Now Rupaya announces the launch of a milestone marketing and advertising campaign aimed at raising awareness for the project. With large initiatives launching throughout the year the marketing campaign is designed to draw fresh attention and promote all aspects of the Rupaya blockchain platform.</p>
<p>The marketing campaign is being timed to coincide with the release of the project’s updated white paper. Marketing and advertising will appear on both general and industry specific sites. Part of the marketing budget will also be used for community building initiatives. The marketing and advertising spend will happen prior to the end of the next governance proposal.</p>
