			<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">― Mother Theresa</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Past: What lead us to here?</strong></p>
<p>When Aasim (Mobay) started the Rupaya project back in 2014, it received little interest from the cryptocurrency community despite being listed on Bittrex.  He continued working hard on the project and saw massive interest in 2017 during the cryptocurrency explosion, which was also when Rupaya hit its all-time-high (ATH). Since the beginning, Aasim has committed large amounts of money and significant time into seeing the success of Rupaya.  The funding was largely sustained by Aasim’s proficiency trading crypto from the early days, which he decided to continue using to finance the project. 2018 brought with it the bear market destroying valuations across the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>At this critical moment several team members took the opportunity to leave the project, resulting in just a handful of active members remaining.  During this same time Aasim was doing his best to cope with a serious illness affecting his son.  He spent months traveling between various doctors in order to get the best treatment possible for his son.  With his anxiety rising, he decided to try a big and risky trade to take the project to the next level.  Unfortunately, that trade went badly, and he lost it all. We (Aasim, TooShameless (Kevin)) have not sold any of our personal RUPX holdings and continue to purchase what we can afford from the market.  Both of us have used large amounts of our personal RUPX holdings to compensate team members for efforts, engage the community, or incentivize social advertising.  By the start of 2019, our active team members had now been reduced to three.  The team members that remain (Mobay, TooShameless, gdiscord) have not taken a single payment from the community, dedicating our time and efforts for free to maintain the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Present: What are we working on now?</strong></p>
<p>Late 2018/2019 arrived with two exploits affecting our project’s codebase, FakeStake and Zerocoin.  We responded quickly and disabled Zerocoin protocol, along with putting the code fix in place for the FakeStake exploit.  We provided a chain analysis showing that malicious actors had not succeeded using either of the attack methods on the RUPX chain. We continued to monitor PIVX’s GitHub closely, since they had been actively working on the fix for Zerocoin.  The PIVX team are now starting their work on a new privacy protocol to replace the vulnerable Zerocoin library.  Impatient with the progress, Aasim had begun researching alternative codebases to use.</p>
<p>Pleased with the initial results from his research, we are preparing a new codebase in which we are confident will open new opportunities for our project.  Aasim has successfully forked the Tomochain codebase and for the past couple months have been testing and fixing various components of the system.  This represents a major change to how all aspects of the current Rupaya network operate.  This is an Ethereum based Proof of Stake (POS) chain supported by masternodes (150 maximum nodes with Proof of stake voting consensus), with ability to support low transaction fees and 2-second confirmation times.  The chain will support all EVM compatible smart contracts which will also enable the creation of dapps and in the future token issuance/integrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future: What comes next?</strong></p>
<p>We are actively seeking more testers for validation of the chain and all functionality therein.  Interested parties need to join our discord <a href="httpss://discord.me/rupaya">httpss://discord.me/rupaya</a>  and then message Aasim (Mobay) or myself (TooShameless) to be added to the program.</p>
<p>Outside of codebase change is another critically important decision.  When we finally swap over to this new chain, should we take this opportunity to contract the supply somewhat and modify masternode requirements/rewards distribution to better accommodate our situation and architecture?  For example, there is a finite quantity of masternode positions available (150), so the team has had internal discussions on whether to substantially raise the value commitment required for masternode status.  Another discussion that is taking place surrounds the supply issue and whether to contract the supply by one-tenth or one-hundredth.</p>
<p>Lastly for those holding Zerocoin we intend for you to be able to swap those coins back shortly.  Please join our discord <a href="httpss://discord.me/rupaya">httpss://discord.me/rupaya</a> for the latest updates and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Final Comments:</strong></p>
<p>The Rupaya team has prided themselves in always being open and honest with the community.  We don’t shy away from tough questions and we continue to work towards success despite how insurmountable the tasks seem.  We acknowledge that our communication with the community has been lacking and most people have lost confidence in our project.  Let this be the first step in correcting that behavior and a symbol of progress towards a better future for all Rupayans!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>TL;DR – RupeeEvolution is not partnered by Rupaya in any way and we strongly advise our community to avoid this project and their proposed swap.</strong></p>
<p>RupeeEvolution is a new cryptocurrency project started initially by disgruntled members of the Rupee Blockchain project. A few of them approached Mobay (Aasim), Velk (Tobias – former team member), and I (TooShameless, Kevin) with the proposition of merging all the South Asia specific projects together under one name.  After a long series of questioning we had concluded that no solid plan outside of “unite together” was available.  We are not the only project that they spoke to who came to this same conclusion.  To add to the problem, Rupee Blockchain, to whom our Founder (Mobay) has spent a long time combating, wanted control over the Rupaya community.  We feel that we possess the better technology and team to support the mission of bringing the digital currency marketplace to the unbanked in South Asia. They must believe we have the better technology as well since they have forked the Rupaya Core wallet and branded it as their own.</p>
<p>The RupeeEvolution team assert that they will provide solutions that don&#8217;t exist and potentially couldn&#8217;t exist from current projects.  Examining in closer detail we find this to be absurdly false.  Thus far their achievement is building a woocommerce store and implementing the woocommerce-altcoin-payment-gateway plugin to accept RUP (plugin found here httpss://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-altcoin-payment-gateway/).  This is an implementation that anyone in the community with desire to setup a retail/service marketplace within woocommerce could achieve utilizing the existing Rupaya system.  Other aspects of their project have yet to see realization.</p>
<p>They have premined approximately 38 MILLION coins to facilitate a series of swaps they will be offering to the Rupee community, Rupaya community, as well as a few others.  This poses a threat to our community and others as they intend to build their team capital with the sale of swapped funds from participating parties.  What that means is they will be taking RUP and RUPX from the community, and then selling them on the market to build their BTC buckets.  All the while preventing swappers from doing anything with their new RupeeEvolution coins as those will not be available to trade on the market for some time.  This funding model does not align with their stance that they “support” these projects, it’s much more akin to “parasitizing” our projects.</p>
<p>By no means is this project endorsed or supported by the Rupaya Core Team.  Our current official stance is to warn our community of this project along with the potential repercussions of their project’s strategy.</p>

			<p>Greetings fellow Rupayans,</p>
<p>It is extremely unfortunate however, today we must deliver the news that Tobias Roediger (most of you know him as Velk) will no longer be a member of the Rupaya core team. In response to the lack of communication to the community, we had enacted a policy back in October 2018 of mandatory communication within the team. We recognize that this is a grassroots project and team members may have other responsibilities that conflict with our schedule. To work around this we believe that consistent communication of our schedules is paramount to effectively working as a small team.</p>
<p>After two weeks without contact from Tobias, we began to worry for Velk&#8217;s whereabouts. At that point we reached out to him across all platforms that we could access him through. We received communication back from Velk, apologizing for the dissappearance but citing personal issues with his business that is requiring all the additional free time that he has. Subsequently he has informed us that he needs to walk away from the Rupaya project and focus on soley his business.</p>
<p>We hope that one day Velk finds his way back to actively participating in the Rupaya community but for now we must say goodbye. We want to thank Velk for all of his hard work, committment, and efforts in helping bring Rupaya to the level it&#8217;s at today. We wish him all the best for him and his company going forward.</p>
<p>In the wake of his absence, Aasim (Mobay) and myself (Kevin, tooshameless) will take over the messaging platforms and community communication responsibilities until such point as we locate a trustworthy and capable replacement. There are numerous activities as part of the transition including account owners, points of contact, as well as the transfer of the marketing budget. Please be patient with us as we solidify the new communication workflow and build the marketing group Rupaya needs.</p>

			<p>Greetings Rupayans,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a brief summary on the recent problems we’ve all been facing with the wallet.</p>
<p>When the team forked the latest PIVX codebase we faced issues with the zerocoin protocol as Pivx introduced the zerocoin v2 protocol which enabled the staking of zerocoins. We hired Martin to help us fork the codebase and the zerocoin v2 was implemented from genesis, Martin removed variables from the original Pivx codebase that were used to transition from zerocoin v1 to zerocoin v2.</p>
<p>Recently a security exploit (fake stake) was discovered by<a href="httpss://medium.com/@dsl_uiuc/fake-stake-attacks-on-chain-based-proof-of-stake-cryptocurrencies-b8b05723f806"> Decentralised System Lab @ UIUC</a>, numerous fixes were released by other teams but we decided to wait and see if PIVX would release its own fix which they did <a href="httpss://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/803">PR803</a>, We quickly scrambled to apply the fix to our codebase once implemented we realized that some variables were removed from our codebase resulting the wallet to crash randomly when it discovered that a fake stake was submitted to the blockchain. After numerous hours spent we discovered what was wrong and a fix has been released in wallet version <a href="httpss://github.com/rupaya-project/rupx/releases/tag/v5.2.0">5.2</a>.</p>
<p>We are thankful to the PIVX Team for promptly fixing the issue and all credit goes to them.</p>
<p>We’ve added a couple of new features from upstream the most notable ones are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="httpss://pivx.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zerocoin_Light_Node_Protocol.pdf">The Zerocoin Light Node Protocol</a> credits to Matias Furszyfer</li>
<li>A new governance tab has been added to make things look clearer and ease the process to vote on proposals</li>
<li><a href="httpss://snapcraft.io/rupaya">Snapcraft</a> builds have been implemented (<a href="httpss://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager)">learn more about snapcraft here</a>)</li>
<li>Numerous other improvements have been committed to (core features, build system, p2p, network, GUI, and the wallet code)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to iron out our shortcomings in the next release and will endeavor to provide a full list of changes made on future releases.</p>
<p>The Rupaya team is committed to the constant betterment and development of our code.  We would like to thank our community for being patient and understanding while they faced constant wallet crashes and constant update requests.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We worked hard to provide the best coin swap process possible. The bot was custom coded, and carefully tested, by our team. More than 1,700 lines of code have been written for the new slate of Rupaya Bots. Your feedback on the swap process will help us improve future bots and feature releases.</p>
<h2>Users may earn up to two raffle entries for feedback</h2>
<p><em>After finishing the coin swap process, take a moment to provide feedback on your experience with the Rupaya SwapBot and be entered into a raffle for one of four prizes of up to 2,500 RUPX. All valid entries will require the <strong>raffle entry code</strong> provided by SwapBot at the very end of your swap process.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re releasing an updated brand identity, which includes a new logo, color palette, and fonts. You’ll see the new look anywhere we’re out in public; our website, Discord, and Twitter. We believe the new look better represents the present and future of Rupaya as the cryptocurrency and digital payment platform of South Asia.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-361" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo.png" alt="New Rupaya logo" width="1290" height="464" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo.png 1290w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo-300x108.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo-768x276.png 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo-1024x368.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1290px) 100vw, 1290px" />Since our founding in 2014 we’ve gone through several logo iterations. Most recently we used the “wheel” logo. The wheel logo, while very iconic, had several key limitations that caused us to look toward new branding. The biggest drawback with the previous logo centered around our inability to use the logo for one color needs. A one color version couldn’t exist because of the intricacies of the artwork. The incredible level of detail also meant that the logo didn’t perform well at small sizes. Together with the launch of Rupaya 5, on a completely redeveloped codebase, it was time for a change.</p>
<p>Our goal was to better represent our values and the users we serve. The design was executed by the advertising agency run by Velk, our head of marketing. We worked to find something that appeared clean, approachable, smart, reliable, friendly, and connected to the South Asia region.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-360" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo-explainer.jpg" alt="Rupaya logo explainer" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo-explainer.jpg 800w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo-explainer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-logo-explainer-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />We hope you enjoy the new look and feel for Rupaya. Watch for more updates over the coming days — such as the updated visual design for our new wallet and a brand-new website design — as we continue to look for new and better ways to serve the payment and transaction needs of South Asia.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following transcript is from the Masternode SCRUM that took place on the INDX Capital Telegram channel on August 17, 2018. Special thanks to Stake &amp; Nodes and INDX Capital for hosting Rupaya. Answering questions for the Rupaya team were <strong>Aasim Khan (Mobay), Kevin Maloney (Tooshameless), T R (velk), and Warren Bullock (Web3)</strong>. The transcript is courtesy INDX Capital.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Allen Hena: </strong>Today’s Masternode Scrum is on Rupaya!, RUPX. First question is if the “!” is part of the official spelling, lol</p>
<p><strong>Muhammad Ali: </strong>Great!</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Maloney <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Thank you for having us, Stakes!</p>
<p><strong>Warren Bullock <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>hello everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Allen Hena: </strong>Thanks for joining</p>
<p><strong>Oliver M INDX: </strong>Hi Allen. Hi everyone</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;Allen Hena: Rupaya is a community coin focus on developing cryptocurrency utilization in the Southeast Asia region</p>
<p><strong>T R <em>[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Happy to be here on behalf of Rupaya</p>
<p><strong>Allen Hena: </strong>They already have a fully functional governance system so there can be proposals and votes. If you visit their website you will see that they have a transparent team which always show a certain level of commitment and maturity: <a href="https://rupx.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://rupx.io/">https://rupx.io/</a></p>
<p><strong>Warren Bullock <em>[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Yes, @StakeAndNodes, we pride ourselves on transparency and community!</p>
<p><strong>Aasim Khan <em>[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Hey thank you for having us here today</p>
<p><strong>Allen Hena: </strong>As community is a significant part of crypto, especially those with masternodes, I can honestly say Rupaya has one of the most lively and engaged communities I’ve seen</p>
<p><strong>Warren Bullock <em>[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>@StakeAndNodes, have you seen our Rupayafest celebration 😉</p>
<p><strong>Allen Hena: </strong>Can someone from the team give some insight into the decision to focus on the Southeast Asia region and which countries are included in that focus?</p>
<p id="dc6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Warren Bullock <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>The community loved it and it was our way to say thank you back to the supporters of our project. It’s the least we could do. Raffle drawings, quizzes</p>
<p id="23ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>Yes I’ve seen that, a good way to engage with the community and attract others</p>
<p id="7e9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">T R <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Certainly. The eight countries in South Asia that we’re focussing on include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka</p>
<p id="9c63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>Was there any criteria or rationale for choosing those countries specifically?</p>
<p id="6baf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>The Idea of a South Asian cryptocurrency came to me in 2014, after being involved in cryptocurrencies for the 2 previous years, I made it my mission bringing the message of blockchain to the people of South Asia</p>
<p id="ef59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>So you’ve been involved for a long time, good to hear</p>
<p id="98b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">T R <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>I think part of the idea behind that was looking at the number of unbanked in the region and seeing a real chance to make a huge difference in peoples lives</p>
<p id="7f93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>Makes sense, some of those countries have experienced some volatility in their own sovereign currencies. I’ve noticed that there are other projects with a similar intent in that region like RUP and DRS, do you see them a competition or a shared mission? And more importantly any distinguishing attributes about RUPX in comparison?</p>
<p id="b4c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>We would if there was any decent development from them, DRS has been abandoned and Rupee has been called a scam</p>
<p id="a7fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">T R <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Not only that but recently a study came out that said that 70% of transactions and 90% of the value of transactions in parts of South Asia are still done in cash. Partially because people have poor access to electricity and limited to no access to banking.</p>
<p id="8586" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>fair enough, often a problem in crypto, long term commitment</p>
<p id="0a82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kevin Maloney <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>There is a high level of truth to this. If there were significant developments coming from those projects, perhaps our mindset would change. Currently though we don’t have them on our radar outside of their names.</p>
<p id="cd68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>[In reply to Kevin Maloney]: <img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p id="3aa8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Developing a cryptocurrency project requires a lot of time and dedication, our team is spread out around the world in different time zones and you can see great dedication in all of us</p>
<p id="c1b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>I know that talking with many of my Indian friends they say that crypto hasnt gotten the traction in India yet because the government has only given red flags to it there. How would RUPX potentially address these challenges?</p>
<p id="4db5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Warren Bullock <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>I also think it’s important to add to the above that we aren’t focusing on how to remove competition, the platform and mission is and will always be at the forefront of our thought process. We have been spending a lot of time discussing strategic developments within the core team</p>
<p id="697a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>There is certainly an opportunity with the population size in the countries you named but obviously there is the gap in tools and awareness to address</p>
<p id="5a5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>[In reply to Warren Bullock] That’s great to know. Communication is very critical on any project team</p>
<p id="e34d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Oliver M INDX: </strong>How many employees does the company have / are most on independent consultancy contracts due to differences in time zones?</p>
<p id="a4af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Warren Bullock <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>@StakeAndNodes we have poured a lot of resources into rebranding ourselves and focusing on wallet usability as well.</p>
<p id="8257" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>I would say that most of our team members are volunteers from the community</p>
<p id="4475" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>[In reply to Oliver M INDX] not sure they are considered a “company” and I also wonder if that’s a goal as I think there is a lot to discuss with forming companies and coins in crypto</p>
<p id="594a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">T R <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Lots of countries are looking at regulation, that’s especially true for cryptocurrencies that governments might see as competing or infringing on their monetary units. However, there’s a very real opportunity to help those bodies shape the future of their governance. And, maybe more importantly, help them see that they can make a technological leap</p>
<p id="ca0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>We have 14 active team members and the team is still growing strong</p>
<p id="c7b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>Very nice</p>
<p id="7bab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Warren Bullock <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>On the question regarding team members / employees. I am a volunteer, and have been involved in the crypto space since 2014. I’ve been involved with Rupaya because I believe in the mission. I like to bring strategic views to the team. My day job helps me in this way as I am a CIO at non-profit 😉</p>
<p id="2cbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>With a strong community there’s an opportunity for a grassroots approach to growing your network effect are there any plans for this in the near term?</p>
<p id="0b4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>[In reply to Warren Bullock] Ah, very cool. Good relevant experience</p>
<p id="ed2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Oliver M INDX: </strong>[In reply to Allen Hena] Of course — I wonder due to long run integration wrt liquidity and transparency</p>
<p id="6a59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Oliver M INDX: </strong>[In reply to Warren Bullock] Awesome</p>
<p id="2efe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">T R <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>I think that the RupayaFest example that Warren mentioned earlier is a great example.</p>
<p id="96ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kevin Malone <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Regulation: I am not sure that regulators even know what their concerns surrounding cryptocurrency are. I think as they understand all the aspects more then there may be actionable steps to take, but at this point I see only pushing the total understanding instead of focusing on any particular educational aspect.</p>
<p id="b10a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>We are looking at the opportunities available in different countries to incorporate ourselves potential countries are : Malta, Estonia, Switzerland</p>
<p id="1c80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">T R <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>That idea was brought forward by a community member, and we all agreed that it sounded fun and ran with it. When the community feels empowered to surface new ideas, and have them acted on, they are more than happy to bring them forward. And as a result the grassroots effort you mentioned becomes even stronger</p>
<p id="21a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kevin Maloney <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Team: For being primarily volunteer based, our core team is far more active and committed than others I have seen and the level of experience and education is impressive!</p>
<p id="c683" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>[In reply to Kevin Maloney] Good point on education, I often tell people to focus on understanding and sharing that understanding first and foremost</p>
<p id="dcec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>I see there is an upcoming swap and collateral change</p>
<p id="8136" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em></strong>: Indeed our mission is first and foremost bringing a understanding of cryptocurrencies</p>
<p id="5fbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kevin Maloney <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Community: There absolutely is opportunity for the “boots on the ground” approach and we certainly have been and are going that route. I always believe that creating a strong local presence and do amazing things for pushing your message at higher levels.</p>
<p id="218a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>Can you share with us some of the reasons and strategy behind this? Some people are concerned about collateral changes specifically during coin swaps</p>
<p id="2460" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>The main reason behind the hard fork is to get on to a more secure codebase</p>
<p id="0221" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>[In reply to Kevin Maloney] Yes I’ve noticed that, I’ve seen the growth of RUPX over the last 6 months myself. I like that regardless of market prices, this community continues to push forward</p>
<p id="7f3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>A codebase we can rely on to build our future products</p>
<p id="b998" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>[In reply to Aasim Khan] can you share some insight to this? don’t be afraid to get technical <img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f603.png" alt="😃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p id="e557" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kevin Maloney <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Side note on the team: 3 of our team members, myself included work at high levels in the non profit industry on the technology side of things. Giving back to the local community is a critical goal in the future.</p>
<p id="be61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>We have forked the latest Pivx codebase, we are lucky to have great developers in our team. As you might know or not Pivx team leaves a lot of land mines behind</p>
<p id="7b35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>[In reply to Kevin Maloney] very good to know, shows leadership for the next level of growth</p>
<p id="a857" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">T R <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>And as a side-side note on the team: I own a small advertising and marketing agency, so all my volunteer work for the team is on the marketing and communications side of things. One of the best things about our team is that we are driven by passion and all have highly specialized skills that we’re able to use daily</p>
<p id="e285" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>Did the issues with Deviant drive some of this?</p>
<p id="a183" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aasim Khan <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>We’ve not experienced any issues as such, our chain is solid.

<p id="1a80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kevin Maloney<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> [Rupaya]</em>: </strong>Collateral Change: With the upcoming codebase change we looked into other aspects of the Rupaya project that we saw as “needing improvement”. A critical area we wanted to focus on was the issue of cost of entry and rapid early inflation. The collateral change was discussed and the main reason for the increase is to raise the entry cost for masternode investment to ensure serious investors that believe in the mission. The block reward structure has been reworked to coincide with the upcoming collateral changes.</p>
<p id="d70a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kevin Maloney <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">[Rupaya]</em>: </strong>A common issue with low cost of entry and high ROI is that you have people looking to reap rewards and dump on a market that doesn’t have the liquidity base yet to support it.</p>

<p id="b379" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Allen Hena: </strong>I do agree that sometimes a higher collateral can help bring more serious investors. Do you anticipate tiered masternodes or did you consider this time?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="httpss://omnianalytics.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="httpss://omnianalytics.io/">Omni Analytics Group</a> has ranked Rupaya as the 11th best masternode coin. Over the past couple weeks we’ve shared a little bit about the ranking on our Discord and Twitter channels.</p>
<p>In this article we’ll discuss some of charts, what they mean, and outline steps we are taking to improve our future ranking as well as give Rupaya users a better experience overall. The data from most of the charts shown is from 7/27 (when we purchased the report) so we have provided up-to-date numbers wherever possible to provide additional context.</p>
<h2>Scorecard Breakdown</h2>
<p>Our masternode scorecard from Omni Analytics shows the key categories that they judge masternode coins on. Overall Rupaya scored as the 11th best project out of several hundred that they’ve ranked.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-223 size-full aligncenter" src="https://206.189.38.170/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-01.png" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-01.png 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-01-300x200.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-01-768x512.png 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-01-1024x683.png 1024w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-01-900x600.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>For the Reward Frequency score, we know that’s a function of having a more robust network of Masternodes. With more than 1,700 masternodes, Rupaya ranks near the very top of masternode projects. It gives us a very stable network, but does increase the amount of time between masternode rewards.</p>
<p>Following on that trend, the Daily ROI Change and ROI (7 Day Average) scores are partially linked to the number of #masternodes. However this is an area that can be positively changed as we continue to prove the value of our project with defined use cases.</p>
<h3>GitHub Score</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-224" src="https://206.189.38.170/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-02.png" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-02.png 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-02-300x200.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-02-768x512.png 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-02-1024x683.png 1024w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-02-900x600.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Omni Analytics research shows that high quality masternodes GitHub repos have a correlation to excellent masternode projects. We are proud of our continual GitHub repository updates to our codebase and documentation. These regular updates and improvements are one of the keys to our success.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our research suggests that the quality of a <a href="httpss://twitter.com/hashtag/masternodes?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="httpss://twitter.com/hashtag/masternodes?src=hash">#masternodes</a> Github repo can be proxied by the number of contributors, forks, stars, watchers, &amp; commits. Even after controlling for the age of the #masternode coin, we found that the better our score, the higher the market cap. — <a href="httpss://twitter.com/OmniAnalytics/status/1013779392563163136" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="httpss://twitter.com/OmniAnalytics/status/1013779392563163136"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">@OmniAnalytics July 2</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<h3>Whitepaper Rank</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-225" src="https://206.189.38.170/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-03.png" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-03.png 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-03-300x200.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-03-768x512.png 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-03-1024x683.png 1024w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-03-900x600.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Our White Paper Score was one of the sections we asked for more clarification on. According to Omni Analytics our paper contains more technical language. Their scoring system is based on Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. The Flesch–Kincaid readability tests are designed to indicate how difficult a passage in English is to understand. And the scoring system found parts of our paper more difficult to read than deemed necessary. Future revisions to the Rupaya white paper will take that into account.</p>
<h3>Masternode Counts</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-226" src="https://206.189.38.170/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-04.png" alt="" width="1200" height="923" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-04.png 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-04-300x231.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-04-768x591.png 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-04-1024x788.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
This graph shows two very interesting things. First you will see that Rupaya is leading the pack by a wide margin, more on that in a moment. The second thing to notice is that this data is from 7/27 and shows the number of Rupaya masternodes at 1,588. Now just over two weeks later the total of active masternodes has grown to 1,711. That means we’ve added 123 master nodes in the past 18 days alone, and are averaging nearly 7 new nodes added to the Rupaya network per day. According to <a href="httpss://masternodes.online/">MasterNodes.online</a> Rupaya ranks in the top 20 for active masternodes.</p>
<p>That circles back nicely to why having a strong network, and Rupaya’s place in the standings, is so important. Transactions on the Rupaya Blockchain are processed through the masternode network. Too few masternodes online and the blockchain becomes highly susceptible to 51% attacks as well as network instability. Our network is large enough to protect against both of these blockchain threats.</p>
<h3>Regional Affordability</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-227" src="https://206.189.38.170/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-05.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="154" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-05.jpeg 800w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-05-300x58.jpeg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-05-768x148.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
A new chart on regional affordability was released by Omni Analytics earlier today (August 13, 2018). It shows Rupaya (RUPX) masternode ownership is very achievable based on average wages in Asia. The purple highlighted cell shows the number of days it would take, on an average wage, to purchase a full Rupaya masternode in Asia.</p>
<h3>ROI Ranking</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228" src="https://206.189.38.170/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-06.png" alt="" width="1200" height="923" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-06.png 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-06-300x231.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-06-768x591.png 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/omni-report-06-1024x788.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Rupaya is not a high ROI coin. The ROI falls below the median as compared to other masternode coins. But we believe that is a very good thing.</p>
<p>There is normally a correlation between high ROI and highly inflationary coins. In that regard Rupaya is far more mature than other projects, and has been working hard to curb inflation (see our Weekly Update from August 6 for more on how we’re continuing to reduce coin inflation).</p>
<p>We also believe that the old methodology for how masternode owners are incentivized to hold and operate nodes must change. And we’re working hard to be on the forefront of that paradigm shift. We believe that ROI calculations will soon become more complex as the masternode landscape transforms into a more full-featured ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We are happy with, though not surprised by, these results from Omni Analytics Group. There are several areas, like the white paper readability score, that will be improved dramatically with future releases. Across the board we are constantly looking for new ways to improve upon the usefulness and value of Rupaya for all of our users.</p>
