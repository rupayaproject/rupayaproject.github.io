			<p>Good Day Fellow Rupayan’s,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been quite a lot of action going on behind the scenes since the last community update.  Let’s take a moment together to recap those happenings in this edition of the Community Update!  We will cover general news, core wallet progress, bot development progress, marketing updates, and the new service provider certification program.</p>
<p><strong><u>General News</u></strong></p>
<p>Our Rupayan community is pleased to welcome Aasim back to full-time with Rupaya.  For those that missed the discord announcement, Aasim (Mobay) had to take some time away from the project for a few weeks to handle a family emergency.  We are excited to not only have him back but to hear that things are all well with his family again.  Many Blessings!</p>
<p>We have received some comments regarding current inflation rates and are discussing as a team what potential remedies are available and how any changes would affect the community.  We as a team are still evaluating the options available, along with the consequences.  Once we are finished, we will approach the community with the findings and open up the topic for discussion.  Thank you to Respio#4122 for spurning this conversation!  We always love to hear from the community, and we encourage you to voice your opinions in the #suggestions channel on discord or by emailing <a href="mailto:info@rupx.io">info@rupx.io</a> .</p>
<p>The month of April also saw the announcement that Kalkulus team has acquired Kevin (tooshameless) as another team developer currently tasked to aid in bringing The Hub online.  The Hub 2.0 will be the latest version of the KLKS team hosting platform.  Rupaya continues to be and will stay Kevin’s first crypto love.  This is a great opportunity to work closely with another talented team and Rupaya Service Provider.  My personal hope is that these relationships grow not just the platforms but the crypto community as a whole.</p>
<p>A perfect example of these benefits can be seen with two new systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is Barterlly ( <a href="httpss://app.barterlly.io">httpss://app.barterlly.io</a> ) where users can create secure over-the-counter trades with atomic swap capabilities using their new launched beta escrow service! Rupaya is one of the lucky few to be added to the initial launch of the product!  Take some time out, setup an account, and test away.  Let’s help Barterlly continue to grow!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-504 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap-300x155.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="155" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap-300x155.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap-768x396.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The second is in the new micro-explorer built for the Kalkulus Hub by development partner turinglabs! Check it out for yourself, but this baby syncs beyond fast! <a href="httpss://github.com/turinglabsorg/micro-explorer">httpss://github.com/turinglabsorg/micro-explorer</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-507"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-507 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer-300x170.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer-768x434.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer.jpg 1862w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Wallet Progress Update</u></strong></p>
<p>With Aasim (Mobay) back full-time the zerocoin exploit has resumed top priority.  We are monitoring the situation closely and even looking into alternative security protocols, should the inevitable fix to zerocoin not be in alignment with our privacy philosophy.  Regardless of the privacy protocol fixes we still needed to assess any potential damages that could have occurred due to these latest exploit findings.</p>
<p>Aasim implemented the new RPC call <strong>getserials</strong> to facilitate the analyzation of our blockchain activity for any invalid zerocoin spends.  Kevin took the script provided by random-zebra of the Pivx team, modified it for Rupaya, then coupled with the newly custom built wallet began analyzing our chain.</p>
<p>We are pleased to report that <strong>we haven’t detected a single invalid zerocoin spend</strong>.  This is in part due to the fact we responded so quickly to the discovery of this issue and disabled zerocoin.</p>
<p><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/not-exploited-zerocoin.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-509" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/not-exploited-zerocoin-300x159.png" alt="" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/not-exploited-zerocoin-300x159.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/not-exploited-zerocoin.png 474w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We are going to continue monitoring the progress and once Pivx commits the changes for releasing the old V2 Zerocoin protocol funds, we will apply the same fix to release any funds currently locked within Zerocoin maintenance mode. As always, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to hop in our discord channel for immediate assistance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Bot Development Progress</u></strong></p>
<p>Our discord bots have gone through quite a bit of redevelopment and are nearing completion.  Over <strong>2000+</strong> lines of code have been changed/added to the codebase.  This includes not just the modifications required to harness the power of the new API wrapper library, but also to expand the feature sets available.</p>
<p>Copbot specifically had upgrades done to its scanning routine, administrative management, and scammer investigation.  Copbot also saw deployment at three new projects recently with Phore, Kalkulus, and Scrypta all requesting the Copbot’s presence protecting their servers from scammers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/copbots.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-505 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/copbots-300x161.png" alt="" width="300" height="161" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/copbots-300x161.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/copbots.png 507w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Tipbot has not only had upgrades to the API library put in, but also the addition of several new account features.  We are currently in the testing phase; however initial reports are very positive.  <strong>Stay tuned for an official release date!  Make sure you turn your umbrellas upside down because of course we will be hosting a celebration party with lots of rain!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/tipbot-help.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-506 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/tipbot-help-187x300.png" alt="" width="187" height="300" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/tipbot-help-187x300.png 187w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/tipbot-help.png 359w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Can you spot some of the new functions?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/twitter-tipbot.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-503 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/twitter-tipbot-300x108.png" alt="" width="300" height="108" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/twitter-tipbot-300x108.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/twitter-tipbot.png 648w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Can you tell where Tipbot is arriving next?</p>
<p><strong><u>Marketing Updates</u></strong></p>
<p>This year we said goodbye to Tobias (Velk), as he has left Rupaya to focus on his personal business and has no longer available time to dedicate to this project.  In his absence Kevin and Aasim have stepped in to fill the void created and we appreciate the community’s patience as we setup the operational processes to allow for us to jointly manage this function.  All of the social network platforms have been transitioned and are now under our control (we are still waiting for a lock on the telegram server to be released, however we do have access to the account).</p>
<p>After vetting a variety of recruitment options, we identified several community members that each held a skill essential to the marketing process.  Those individuals will be working on a contract basis to provide the requisite marketing materials used for our campaign promotions.  There are individuals with whom we feel would be great assets to the marketing team, however the cost to have them on the team full-time is beyond our reach at this current moment.</p>
<p><strong>What work or materials has been done so far…?</strong></p>
<p>We have commissioned a sixty second promotional video that explains the mission and purpose behind the Rupaya Project.  This video has been completed and will be released later this weekend.  We look forward to having more informational and educational videos produced as the Rupaya ecosystem grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Join us in our discord server this weekend to celebrate the release of the new video!</strong></p>
<p>Other commissioned work includes a series of graphics that will be used for advocacy and general promotion.</p>
<p>Our listing with MasterNodesPro (MNP) has been renewed for the year!  They have established themselves as the #1 resource for masternode statistical information (#1 Alexa Rank!). We look forward to growing our relationship with MNP even further during the upcoming months!</p>
<p>We have also setup a Lifetime listing with Masternodes.Live (MNL)! Project page just went live the other day, excited to see all the stats once they are fully synced up.  Give them a little time to make sure all the information is just right.</p>
<p><strong>What is coming next?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently exploring two large promotional campaigns with separate service providers; however, we cannot share more at this time, as the details are still being worked out.  Stay tuned!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Service Provider Certification Program</u></strong></p>
<p>Lastly, we have kicked our Service Provider Certification program!  This program will be reviewing, cataloging, and scoring all currently known Rupaya Service Providers.  These results will be compiled by the team and released to the entire crypto community in a special press release.  The features and functionality essential to hosting a secure environment and providing full value to our users for their investments will be the cornerstones of our certification program.  An example of a feature we will be looking for would be access to your private keys.  Other feature examples could be two-factor authentication or something as simple as real time support (Discord, telegram).  We are going to use this program to encourage better relationships and features from our service providers, as well as provide our community with reputable feedback regarding the service providers offerings.</p>

			<p>Evening Rupayan Community,</p>
<p>First of all we would like to apologize for not releasing community updates in a regular and timely fashion for a long time now. We know that an essential component to our success is to keep open and fair communication channels with the community consistent. Unfortunately we have to admit that we have been too sparing with this issue lately and the whole team apologizes for this!</p>
<p>In order to avoid this error going forward the team decided to advertise a position as Community Update Manager to keep the community up to date with the latest information about the state of Rupaya.</p>
<p>For this we have offered the position to Rohin (Rupx Armadillo), who graciously accepted, and we should all welcome him to the core team. Rohin has been a long time active community member with a dedication to the success of the project and mission.  He has decided to give up his earnings related to this position to the community in the form of Tips and Raffle Seeds.</p>
<p>Currently we were discussing within the team how we could organize a Q&amp;A evening for the community. We would like to ask for questions from the community and introduce the team, in a further effort to make the project as transparent as possible.</p>
<p>The Rupaya team recognizes that the community would like to see more and more developments regarding the project.  Since we are a small team at the core we have decided to post various recruitment opportunities for the community to join us in helping accelerate the visibility, accessibility, and usability of Rupaya. People from various fields such as graphic design and content creation have already registered and we want to thank you for the immediate response! The lists are compiled as as each initiative begins we will be reaching out to those that responded.  All positions are currently still open and we will continue to expand as possible. Please do not hesitate to submit your application today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Bot Development:</u></strong></p>
<p>Development work for our various Discord bots took a brief hiatus in January as Shameless (Kevin) and Gwal (Gregory) had outside commitments take priority.  Development has resumed, and new features are being worked on to provide our users with ease of use, better security and in general, a more satisfying user experience. Did someone say QR codes and two factor authentication? These features will be put through thorough testing before they are implemented into the TipBot but they are planned to be released in the near future!</p>
<p><a href="https://rupx.io/qr1/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-475" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/qr1-300x225.jpg" alt="QR Paper" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/qr1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/qr1-768x575.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/qr1-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/qr1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> </a><a href="https://rupx.io/qr2/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-476" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/qr2-300x262.png" alt="Digital QR Code" width="300" height="262" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/qr2-300x262.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/qr2.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="https://rupx.io/2fa-poc/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-474" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/2fa-poc-300x274.png" alt="2fa POC" width="300" height="274" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/2fa-poc-300x274.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/2fa-poc.png 562w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Wallet releases:</u></strong><br />
Rupaya released a new wallet update with a built-in governance proposal tab and many more small tweaks and new features. This wallet also has a fix for the POS (Proof-Of-Stake) Fake Stake vulnerability which was discovered in the majority of POS coins this year. One of the most popular decentralized exchanges, CryptoBridge closed withdrawals and deposits for a large number of coins believed to have the vulnerability in the chain ( <u><a href="httpss://crypto-bridge.org/2019/01/24/deposit-and-withdrawal-precautions-fake-stake-vulnerability/">httpss://crypto-bridge.org/2019/01/24/deposit-and-withdrawal-precautions-fake-stake-vulnerability/</a></u> ). Rupaya was not identified as being affected, however we still have made the necessary patches in the latest update to fully ensure all funds stay safe and secure.</p>
<p>We know that it currently takes a lot of time to update the frequent wallet releases but we can assure you that this is only in the interest of the project. As so often it comes to smaller problems in the development of new technology but we can assure you that the team will always do its best to fix problems as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Explorer updates:</u></strong><br />
Our main explorer find.rupx.io has been given a complete makeover for a sleeker new look and better user experience. Address claiming is one of the new features that has been added to the explorer. A new iquidus explorer has also been launched after a discrepancy with MnZone which led to the dissolution of our partnership with them. This means that rupx.mn.zone is no longer a service provider to Rupaya and should not be used for any Rupaya related network information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>New exchange listings:</u></strong></p>
<p>Rupaya has been listed on the newly re-launched Nova Exchange with BTC and DOGE pairs. The addition of this exchange will help Rupaya in increasing our daily volume as well as attracting more people who will join us in our cause for a better and advanced financial system for South Asia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Documentation Portal</u></strong></p>
<p>The Rupaya documentation Portal, <u><a href="httpss://docs.rupx.io">httpss://docs.rupx.io</a></u> ,  provides easy to follow manuals to our users for setting up their masternodes as well as information on many different Rupaya related topics. The documentation portal goes through continuous update to make sure all information there is 100% up to date.  If you wish to contribute to the Documentation library, please contact one of the core team members to get the ball rolling.</p>

<h2>Project Development Updates</h2>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this edition of the Community Update we will cover general news, Discord bot upgrades, the coin swap extension program, core development progress, marketing updates, and much more.</p>
<h2>Project Development Updates</h2>
<h3>The Bots are Coming Back to Town</h3>
<p>After the resounding success of the Rupaya CoinSwap Bot, we are launching several new and improved bots. TipBot and RaffleBot as well as an all new PoliceBot to prevent Discord fraudsters will be coming to the Rupaya Discord server this week.</p>
<p>These bots have gone through a complete overhaul (over 2,000 lines of code changed) taking them from the old python library to the new rewrite. What kinds of new features can you expect? Here’s a real quick rundown.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Currency Conversion</strong> — The new tipbot comes with the ability to calculate conversion of rupx to fiat equivalent. This means that you can ad-hoc check how much RUPX equals a set fiat amount, or you can also set your default fiat so that all of your transactions are also shown with the fiat equivalent value of your choice. These currency rates are updated hourly through an API connection for European Central Banking rates.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>True Transaction Fees on TipBot</strong> — There is no longer a 1 RUPX fee for withdrawals. We check to ensure you have at least .01 more than what you wish to send but then make sure to only reduce the balance by the actual transaction fee cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>You now can tip/rain/withdraw less than 1 RUPX.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Soaks</strong> will only apply to those in the community that have earned the “Soak Worthy” role!</p>
<ul>
<li>Soaks also have a mandatory minimum of 10 RUPX.</li>
<li>You must opt-in initially to receive “soaks” but you also have the option to opt-out if you don’t wish to receive them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You now can purchase raffle tickets directly from your tipbot balance, no more having to transfer and wait to purchase tickets!</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> All bots have enhanced backend administrative features as well as enhanced connection reset and error handling.</p>
<h3>Main CoinSwap Completed</h3>
<p>Following the completion of the Rupaya Coin Swap event we wanted to share a couple key, and impressive stats.</p>
<ul>
<li>23,895,690.4202245 Coins swapped through the RUPX Coin Swap Bot</li>
<li>591 swap accounts were created</li>
<li>411 swaps were completed in the first 10 days!</li>
<li>More than a 92% satisfaction rating with our swap process</li>
</ul>
<h3><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Major Coin Swap Update</h3>
<p>Since there were a significant number of people that started but weren’t able to complete their swap within the allotted time, we have decided to open the coin swap bot back up <strong>for one week only</strong>, and <strong>ONLY to those that have already started but not finished their swap.</strong></p>
<p>This means that the SwapBot will have the $start command DISABLED and will ONLY work for those that have already started their swaps but did not complete in time.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>No new swaps will be accepted.</strong> The SwapBot will open back up on November 10, 2018 and be available until 11:59PM UTC November 17, 2017.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you started your swap but are still unable to complete during that week then it is <strong>YOUR RESPONSIBILITY</strong> to reach out to a core team member to see if any special arrangement can be made.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2757.png" alt="❗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>Any swaps not completed by the final date will be added to the coin burn amount. The coin burn will take place at the end of the month once we have had time to reconcile the snapshot balance to the amount that was swapped. With respect to transparency, the coin burn will be recorded and documented for the community to review.</em></p>
<h2>Discord Safety Tip</h2>
<p><em>Here’s a nifty safety tip from the keyboard of team member Kevin (@tooshameless#1337 on Discord).</em></p>
<p>First off, you will need developer mode for this to work.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>Need to know how to enable Discord’s Developer mode? Visit: <a href="httpss://discordia.me/developer-mode">httpss://discordia.me/developer-mode</a>.</em></p>
<p>With this mode enabled, you can get the user id with a right click or a push-hold on mobile. You can also get the id by putting a backslash in front of whatever you want the id for. For example, entering:</p>
<p><code>\@tooshameless#1337</code></p>
<p>will return the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;@322163518046732288&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can also use this in reverse. For example if a person has changed their nickname to try and avoid being found or in order to have different names in different servers. In Discord if you enter:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;@322163518046732288&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Then the users current nickname will be returned in the channel.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2757.png" alt="❗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>Please keep these methods in mind. They are especially useful when approached via DM by someone claiming to be from the Rupaya team. You will be able to quickly and easily check to see that they are who they say they are.</em></p>
<h2>New Services</h2>
<p>Over the last couple weeks Rupaya has been listed with several new services. Be sure to check them all out and give us a rating where you can!</p>

<h2>Delta Direct Updates</h2>
<p>Rupaya is now live on Delta Direct. All the latest RUPX updates will now be directly available on Delta tracking app.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you use Delta to track your portfolio be sure to enable notifications for our Direct updates within the app so you never miss out on important project news or updates!</p>
<p>We’re very excited about this addition to our notification options and hope that it will bring additional exposure and increased reputation to our project.</p>
<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
<h3>Rupaya Presentation</h3>
<p>Our marketing lead Tobias (velk#8724 on Discord) recently spoke about Rupaya and our mission to a packed room at the 2018 Digital Crossroads, put on by the Louisville Digital Association in Louisville, KY. The presentation covered an overview of what Rupaya is, our overarching vision, and regional focus.</p>
<p>The majority of the audience was not cryptocurrency savvy. So this was a completely new audience for our project.</p>
<p>Our project got additional shoutouts from two following presenters who were impressed with the initial presentation and what we are developing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation.jpg" alt="Rupaya 2018 LDA Conference Presentation" width="1200" height="832" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation.jpg 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation-300x208.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation-768x532.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation-1024x710.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is our first Community Update since the hard fork and coin swap event started. In this edition of the Community Update we will cover the progress of the swap event, performance of the Rupaya SwapBot, general news, development progress, and a marketing update.</p>
<h2>Project Development Updates</h2>
<p>Rupaya 5 is the first known fork from the PIVX 3.1 codebase. This is a major accomplishment, and is due to the incredible work of our development team.</p>
<p>Coin Swap Progress<br />
The coin swap process is in full swing. As a reminder, <strong>users must complete all swaps before 11:59PM UTC on October 31, 2018</strong>. Any un-swapped coins will be lost after that point.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>Do not wait until October 31 to request a manual swap.</em></p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-338" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/coin-swap-notice.jpg" alt="Rupaya Coin Swap Notice" width="1200" height="360" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/coin-swap-notice.jpg 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/coin-swap-notice-300x90.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/coin-swap-notice-768x230.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/coin-swap-notice-1024x307.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h3>
<h3>Rupaya SwapBot</h3>
<p>So far more than 380 swaps have been completed, with more than 460 registered, through the Rupaya SwapBot.</p>
<p>Roughly 33% of everyone who has completed a swap through the bot has provided feedback about the process via our SwapBot feedback form or on Twitter. The feedback we’re receiving has been overwhelmingly positive. Based on more than 150 feedback responses so far, users have given the bot swap process an <strong>overall satisfaction rating of 92%.</strong></p>
<h3>Masternodes</h3>
<ul>
<li>620 Masternodes online <em>(this is the equivalent of 1,240 masternodes on the old Rupaya 4 chain)</em></li>
<li>12,400,000 coins are locked in masternodes</li>
<li><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> There are still 109 Masternodes with the ‘Unreachable’ designation. Be sure to check https://rupx5.mn.zone/ to ensure that your MN is online and contributing to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a little bit of context. With the update in collateral, when the Rupaya 5 network reaches 880 masternodes we will have the same number of coins locked as we did at the very height of the Rupaya 4 chain (August 31, 2018) right before people began tearing them down in preparation for the swap.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>There are still more than 200 masternodes on the old chain. There is no reason for those to still be active. <strong>None of them are earning valid rewards</strong>. Be sure to tear them down and get your coins swapped as soon as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>For every manual swap that occurs our team has an incredibly difficult task. The sooner you get the process started, the safer your coins will be. And the sooner you can start earning rewards again!</em></p>
<h3>Documentation Center</h3>
<p>The brand new Rupaya Documentation Center is where to find important documentation about our project. Still in its infancy, we will be adding to, and rapidly growing, this repository of knowledge as time goes on. Looking for masternode setup guides, information about security, or the Rupaya press kit? You will find it on the Documentation Center.</p>
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>The current website splash page is just a placeholder. We needed to update the face of the site to match the new branding but didn’t have a chance to finish the full site design before the hard fork.</p>
<p>We believe our new site is a market sector leading design, and it will fundamentally change the way users view and interact with cryptocurrency sites. We’ll be finalizing the new site over the next several weeks and can’t wait to share the new design, and launch the full site.</p>
<h3>Wallet UI</h3>
<p>We’re still working on the updated Wallet UI. The current wallet 5.0.25 skin is just an intermediary step to the final UI. The wallet dev and UI designers have been working hard to iron out the final device display and deeper webhook connection issues in order to bring the final version of the Rupaya 5 wallet to market as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
<h3>Updating Data Sites</h3>
<p>There are a large number of coin data aggregation and information sites out there. Users often discover projects like ours on a variety of sites, possibly making decisions about which projects to look at in more depth.</p>
<p>These sites gather whatever data they can, but then leave it up to users (or teams) to provide updates. Unfortunately these site rarely ever notify teams that they are providing information, and thus when major changes occur the “data” sites provide inaccurate information until someone happens to notice and notify the team. The issues for projects like ours are very clear. New users may be turned off or away by what looks like a dead project, simply because a data site never updated to look at the new explorer URL.</p>
<p>We know there are still sites out there with incorrect data about Rupaya. The hard fork ensures that almost all of them have incorrect data. We’re providing updated information to as many of them as we are aware of.</p>
<p>If there’s a site you frequent for coin info and you notice incorrect or out of date information about Rupaya, please let our team know via a DM on Discord.</p>
<h3>Blockfolio and Delta</h3>
<p>In addition to submitting our updated logo to the crypto tracking apps Blockfolio and Delta, we also requested inclusion in both of their new project update services. Called Blockfolio Signal and Delta Direct respectively, these new services allow project teams to send notifications for news, info, and updates to anyone who opts-in and tracks or watches Ruapya via the apps.</p>
<p>We believe this will greatly broaden our reach and are excited to start rolling it out as soon as possible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekly community update is all about the upcoming hard fork and coinswap. Users are responsible for carefully following this, as well as all other published guides, and for completing the swap within the designated timeframe. All dates are based on the UTC timezone.</p>
<h2>Why is Rupaya Doing a Swap?</h2>
<p>Our planned upgrade to the Rupaya 5.0 codebase is a significant step forward for our project. The changes to the codebase will enable us to hit key parts of our roadmap in a faster and more efficient manner. Additional information was published in our <a href="https://rupx.io/community-update/rupaya-community-update-august-20-2018/235/">August 20, 2018 Community Update</a>. These large improvements to our feature-set necessitate that we move to a brand new chain, resulting in a required coinswap for all users.</p>
<h2>Rupaya 5.0 Coinswap Timeline and Procedure</h2>
<h3>Coin Consolidation Deadline — September 30, 2018</h3>
<p>Users must combine all RUPX coins in one single desktop wallet address (includes multiple masternodes, staking wallets, Discord TipBot, Discord RaffleBot, and all coins held on any exchanges) before the Snapshot Block on October 1st is taken.</p>
<p>Please be sure to consolidate all coins to a single address on your desktop wallet on or before September 30 to ensure the smoothest transition possible and that all coins are accounted for.</p>
<p><em>Make sure to allow enough time for all transactions to clear before the deadline. And remember, exchanges occasionally have coin withdrawal delays, so be sure to plan accordingly.</em></p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you have minted zerocoins then be sure to convert those back to RUPX before the deadline. <strong>DO NOT MINT ANY MORE ZEROCOINS!</strong></p>
<h3>Disable All Masternodes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Launch each masternode VPS and stop the Rupaya service using the command <em><strong>rupaya-cli stop</strong></em></li>
<li>Open your Rupaya masternode.conf file on the machine running your cold wallet</li>
<li>Comment out (or delete) all masternode configuration lines</li>
<li>Save and close your Rupaya masternode.conf file</li>
<li>Close your desktop Rupaya 4 wallet</li>
</ol>
<h3>Consolidate All Your Coins</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open your rupaya.conf file and make sure that this line exists: <em><strong>staking=0</strong></em></li>
<li>Save and close your rupaya.conf file</li>
<li>Reopen your desktop Rupaya 4 Wallet</li>
<li>Go to Preferences and in the Wallet tab and ensure that ‘Enable coin control features’ is checked (see figure 1 below)</li>
<li>Go to the Receive tab and create a brand new receiving address with a distinguishing label such as RUPXswap</li>
<li>Login to any exchanges where you hold Rupaya and send all those coins to your designated swap address (<img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> it is recommended that you do this as early as possible since exchanges occasionally have delays processing withdrawals that could prevent the consolidation of all your coins prior to October 1 Snapshot Block deadline)</li>
<li>Login to the Rupaya Discord and send all coins from the Rupaya TipBot and RaffleBot to your designated swap address</li>
<li>Go to the Send tab in your Rupaya 4 wallet and select the Coin Control button</li>
<li>Select All inputs and then send all of the coins in your wallet to your designated swap address to create one transaction output with all of your RUPX holdings</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>Failure to consolidate all your coins prior to the deadline will require users to <strong>request a manual swap process</strong>. Users requiring a manual swap will be assisted by the team as time permits, and will not be prioritized above other help requests.</em></p>

<h3>Coinswap Begins — October 1, 2018</h3>
<p>Prior to October 1, 2018 we will publish the full step-by-step guides for how to download and install the new Rupaya 5.0 wallet (desktop and masternode) and using the Rupaya SwapBot to change out your old coins for the new ones.</p>
<p>Any transactions after the October 1 Snapshot Block (including any and all Rupaya 4 masternode rewards and stakes) will be deemed invalid and will be worthless. Users will have a month to complete the swap from Rupaya 4 to the Rupaya 5 chain. There is a brief two week window where the block rewards are significantly lower to allow users time to complete the swap. Please take this into consideration and complete your swap as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The fastest way to complete your swap is by following the instructions and working with the Rupaya SwapBot. <strong>All swaps must be completed by the end date, no exceptions.</strong></p>
<h3>Coinswap Ends — October 31, 2018</h3>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2757.png" alt="❗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><em>The Rupaya coinswap ends at 11:59 PM UTC on October 31, 2018. <strong>Any coins not swapped by this time will be lost permanently.</strong></em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekly community update includes a reminder about all the new things launching on October 1, flags the hard fork and collateral change, a new Press section, details on marketing progress, contest overviews, and more.</p>
<h2>Community News</h2>
<h3>New Shared Masternode Host Listings</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone will have the technical skill, or the desire, to manually set up and host their own masternodes. That’s why we’re happy to announce two more masternode hosting services have added Rupaya.</p>
<p>Rupaya is on the <a href="httpss://p.gincoin.io/#!/">GIN Platform</a>, in their Tier 2 category</p>
<p>Rupaya is on <a href="httpss://www.nodestop.com/">NodeStop</a>, with their one-click masternode hosting service</p>
<p><em>As with all service providers, be sure to do your own research and understand all fees and risks before choosing the solution that is right for you.</em></p>
<h3>Mass Adoption Twitter Poll</h3>
<p>This past week we asked, in a highly unscientific Twitter poll, which two countries in South Asia you believe will be the first to achieve mass adoption of Rupaya.</p>
<p><strong>The Results:</strong> India took top honors, Pakistan came in second, and Maldives was a very distant third place.</p>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss these results as simply a representation of population size. However, it is possible that the results hint at a deeper sentiment. There was quite a bit of positive news regarding India’s increasing openness to blockchain that came out this week. Coupled with leadership changes in Pakistan, and Maldives becoming more directly connected to the world, there is a strong foundation for these choices.</p>
<h2>Project Development</h2>
<h3>One Day, Lots of Updates</h3>
<p>The team has been working extremely hard on a whole set of significant updates for Rupaya that will all be launching on October 1, 2018. Here’s the rundown of what you should be watching for:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Rupaya logo and brand identity</li>
<li>Project hard fork to Rupaya 5.0</li>
<li>Masternode collateral increase</li>
<li>All new wallet UI design</li>
<li>Completely refreshed, and easier to use, documentation portal</li>
<li>New website design</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hard Fork and Collateral Change Reminder</h3>
<p>It was mentioned above, but is worth repeating again. The upcoming hard fork will happen on October 1st, 2018. On that date the required collateral for a Rupaya masternode will double. Starting with the hard fork masternode collateral will be 20k RUPX.</p>
<p><em>For masternode owners wishing to keep the same number of active nodes, please be sure to secure any additional coins prior to that date.</em></p>
<h2>Press</h2>
<h3>Rupaya In The News</h3>
<p>This past week Rupaya had several mentions in the news. These were mainly related to our participation in the ongoing MasternodeMeBro18 competition.</p>
<ul>

<h2>Community News</h2>
<h3>Interview with Brian D Colwell</h3>
<p>Two days ago our interview with Brian D Colwell (aka THE Crypto Hobbit on Twitter) went live. Titled “Rupaya: The Future Of Money In SouthAsia” this detailed interview covered a wide range of topics. Once again questions were answered by Aasim (Mobay), Kevin (Tooshameless), Tobias (Velk), and Warren (Web3) from the Rupaya team.</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Rupaya is a strong community bonded together by a single mission, to bring South Asia the digital currency technology it deserves and needs to connect into the global marketplace. <em><strong>— Kevin (Tooshameless), Brian Colwell interview</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Project Developments</h2>
<h3>Hard Fork and Collateral Change Reminder</h3>
<p>The upcoming hard fork will happen on October 1st, 2018. On that date the required collateral for a Rupaya masternode will double. Starting with the hard fork masternode collateral will be 20k RUPX.</p>
<p>For masternode owners wishing to keep the same number of active nodes, please be sure to secure any additional coins prior to that date.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-370" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/masternodemebro-graphic.jpg" alt="MasternodeMeBro18" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/masternodemebro-graphic.jpg 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/masternodemebro-graphic-300x169.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/masternodemebro-graphic-768x432.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/masternodemebro-graphic-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
In the past round of the MasternodeMeBro18 competition Rupaya was pitted against Linda Coin. There was some “suspicious activity” on several of the battles, multiple votes coming from a single IP address. That forced us into a brief sudden death round with Linda, which we also won.</p>
<p>Next we go up against Bulwark Coin. They will be a tough opponent. We’ll need everyone’s help in order to win this round.</p>
<p><img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong><a href="httpss://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QN2TXFT">Go vote now!</a></strong> <img src="httpss://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f448.png" alt="👈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><em>Remember that only one vote is allowed per IP address. So if you‘re in multi-machine environment, such as an office or university, we’d encourage you to vote from home, a cafe or coffee shop to ensure your vote is counted!</em></p>
<h3>Fortune and Glory</h3>
<p>The MasternodeMeBro18 tournament isn’t all fun and games. There are some fairly cool rewards for the winners, and several new prizes have been announced recently.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the the upcoming hardfork will happen on October 1st, 2018. In the coming weeks we will announce the exact snapshot block which will serve as the cutoff for the new chain. Be sure to start planning now around that date. More details will be released as we get closer to the deadline, and roll out a smooth transition.</p>
<h3>New Blockchain Development</h3>
<p>Over the past several weeks the new codebase has been in constant development. Our core development team is actively stress testing the new Rupaya blockchain to ensure it operates flawlessly upon launch. The team is running testnets to further flesh out the feature set and validate chain performance.</p>
<h3>The Bots are Coming, The Bots are Coming</h3>
<p>As if there wasn’t enough going on with the new codebase implementation, our devs are also working on a bevy of new TipBot’s (Tipbots are being worked on for Discord, Twitter, Reddit, and Steem). In addition to the new and improved tipbots, a custom automated Coin Swap bot to handle our transition for the hard fork is almost ready for testing. We’re always think of and working on new ways to make everything easier for our users.</p>
<h3>Masternode Collateral Increase Reminder</h3>
<p>Just a reminder that the collateral required for a Rupaya Masternode will increase from 10k to 20k following the hard fork.</p>
<p>The collateral change is important for the future of Rupaya and coupled with the new reward structure will slow the coin inflation and help protect masternode ownership value. The investment in a Rupaya masternode is a long term investment in the projects mission and vision. We believe this will encourage the right investors, which will in turn increase participation in governance voting of quality proposals.</p>
<h3>Block Reward Changes</h3>
<p>After much deliberation we would like to present the new reward structure which will become effective with the hard fork. This structure will allow for a slow two week onramp during the coin swap period in the hopes this gives users plenty of time without concern of missing out on the new chain rewards.</p>
<h3>All New Rupaya Documentation Center</h3>
<p>As Rupaya has grown and evolved our documentation process has gotten a little messy. Key information is scattered over several sites and tough to locate. Not only is this process daunting for new users, it doesn’t meet the Rupaya’s high standards.</p>
<p>To address this our team is going through a total overhaul of the documentation library. Major portions of the Rupaya documentation are being rewritten and catagorized. Everything from branding guidelines to wallet details will all be consolidated to a single searchable site.</p>
