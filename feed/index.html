			<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">― Mother Theresa</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Past: What lead us to here?</strong></p>
<p>When Aasim (Mobay) started the Rupaya project back in 2014, it received little interest from the cryptocurrency community despite being listed on Bittrex.  He continued working hard on the project and saw massive interest in 2017 during the cryptocurrency explosion, which was also when Rupaya hit its all-time-high (ATH). Since the beginning, Aasim has committed large amounts of money and significant time into seeing the success of Rupaya.  The funding was largely sustained by Aasim’s proficiency trading crypto from the early days, which he decided to continue using to finance the project. 2018 brought with it the bear market destroying valuations across the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>At this critical moment several team members took the opportunity to leave the project, resulting in just a handful of active members remaining.  During this same time Aasim was doing his best to cope with a serious illness affecting his son.  He spent months traveling between various doctors in order to get the best treatment possible for his son.  With his anxiety rising, he decided to try a big and risky trade to take the project to the next level.  Unfortunately, that trade went badly, and he lost it all. We (Aasim, TooShameless (Kevin)) have not sold any of our personal RUPX holdings and continue to purchase what we can afford from the market.  Both of us have used large amounts of our personal RUPX holdings to compensate team members for efforts, engage the community, or incentivize social advertising.  By the start of 2019, our active team members had now been reduced to three.  The team members that remain (Mobay, TooShameless, gdiscord) have not taken a single payment from the community, dedicating our time and efforts for free to maintain the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Present: What are we working on now?</strong></p>
<p>Late 2018/2019 arrived with two exploits affecting our project’s codebase, FakeStake and Zerocoin.  We responded quickly and disabled Zerocoin protocol, along with putting the code fix in place for the FakeStake exploit.  We provided a chain analysis showing that malicious actors had not succeeded using either of the attack methods on the RUPX chain. We continued to monitor PIVX’s GitHub closely, since they had been actively working on the fix for Zerocoin.  The PIVX team are now starting their work on a new privacy protocol to replace the vulnerable Zerocoin library.  Impatient with the progress, Aasim had begun researching alternative codebases to use.</p>
<p>Pleased with the initial results from his research, we are preparing a new codebase in which we are confident will open new opportunities for our project.  Aasim has successfully forked the Tomochain codebase and for the past couple months have been testing and fixing various components of the system.  This represents a major change to how all aspects of the current Rupaya network operate.  This is an Ethereum based Proof of Stake (POS) chain supported by masternodes (150 maximum nodes with Proof of stake voting consensus), with ability to support low transaction fees and 2-second confirmation times.  The chain will support all EVM compatible smart contracts which will also enable the creation of dapps and in the future token issuance/integrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future: What comes next?</strong></p>
<p>We are actively seeking more testers for validation of the chain and all functionality therein.  Interested parties need to join our discord <a href="https://discord.me/rupaya">https://discord.me/rupaya</a>  and then message Aasim (Mobay) or myself (TooShameless) to be added to the program.</p>
<p>Outside of codebase change is another critically important decision.  When we finally swap over to this new chain, should we take this opportunity to contract the supply somewhat and modify masternode requirements/rewards distribution to better accommodate our situation and architecture?  For example, there is a finite quantity of masternode positions available (150), so the team has had internal discussions on whether to substantially raise the value commitment required for masternode status.  Another discussion that is taking place surrounds the supply issue and whether to contract the supply by one-tenth or one-hundredth.</p>
<p>Lastly for those holding Zerocoin we intend for you to be able to swap those coins back shortly.  Please join our discord <a href="https://discord.me/rupaya">https://discord.me/rupaya</a> for the latest updates and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Final Comments:</strong></p>
<p>The Rupaya team has prided themselves in always being open and honest with the community.  We don’t shy away from tough questions and we continue to work towards success despite how insurmountable the tasks seem.  We acknowledge that our communication with the community has been lacking and most people have lost confidence in our project.  Let this be the first step in correcting that behavior and a symbol of progress towards a better future for all Rupayans!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Good Day Fellow Rupayan’s,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been quite a lot of action going on behind the scenes since the last community update.  Let’s take a moment together to recap those happenings in this edition of the Community Update!  We will cover general news, core wallet progress, bot development progress, marketing updates, and the new service provider certification program.</p>
<p><strong><u>General News</u></strong></p>
<p>Our Rupayan community is pleased to welcome Aasim back to full-time with Rupaya.  For those that missed the discord announcement, Aasim (Mobay) had to take some time away from the project for a few weeks to handle a family emergency.  We are excited to not only have him back but to hear that things are all well with his family again.  Many Blessings!</p>
<p>We have received some comments regarding current inflation rates and are discussing as a team what potential remedies are available and how any changes would affect the community.  We as a team are still evaluating the options available, along with the consequences.  Once we are finished, we will approach the community with the findings and open up the topic for discussion.  Thank you to Respio#4122 for spurning this conversation!  We always love to hear from the community, and we encourage you to voice your opinions in the #suggestions channel on discord or by emailing <a href="mailto:info@rupx.io">info@rupx.io</a> .</p>
<p>The month of April also saw the announcement that Kalkulus team has acquired Kevin (tooshameless) as another team developer currently tasked to aid in bringing The Hub online.  The Hub 2.0 will be the latest version of the KLKS team hosting platform.  Rupaya continues to be and will stay Kevin’s first crypto love.  This is a great opportunity to work closely with another talented team and Rupaya Service Provider.  My personal hope is that these relationships grow not just the platforms but the crypto community as a whole.</p>
<p>A perfect example of these benefits can be seen with two new systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is Barterlly ( <a href="https://app.barterlly.io">https://app.barterlly.io</a> ) where users can create secure over-the-counter trades with atomic swap capabilities using their new launched beta escrow service! Rupaya is one of the lucky few to be added to the initial launch of the product!  Take some time out, setup an account, and test away.  Let’s help Barterlly continue to grow!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-504 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap-300x155.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="155" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap-300x155.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap-768x396.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/barterlly-swap.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The second is in the new micro-explorer built for the Kalkulus Hub by development partner turinglabs! Check it out for yourself, but this baby syncs beyond fast! <a href="https://github.com/turinglabsorg/micro-explorer">https://github.com/turinglabsorg/micro-explorer</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-507"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-507 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer-300x170.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer-768x434.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/micro-explorer.jpg 1862w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Wallet Progress Update</u></strong></p>
<p>With Aasim (Mobay) back full-time the zerocoin exploit has resumed top priority.  We are monitoring the situation closely and even looking into alternative security protocols, should the inevitable fix to zerocoin not be in alignment with our privacy philosophy.  Regardless of the privacy protocol fixes we still needed to assess any potential damages that could have occurred due to these latest exploit findings.</p>
<p>Aasim implemented the new RPC call <strong>getserials</strong> to facilitate the analyzation of our blockchain activity for any invalid zerocoin spends.  Kevin took the script provided by random-zebra of the Pivx team, modified it for Rupaya, then coupled with the newly custom built wallet began analyzing our chain.</p>
<p>We are pleased to report that <strong>we haven’t detected a single invalid zerocoin spend</strong>.  This is in part due to the fact we responded so quickly to the discovery of this issue and disabled zerocoin.</p>
<p><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/not-exploited-zerocoin.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-509" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/not-exploited-zerocoin-300x159.png" alt="" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/not-exploited-zerocoin-300x159.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/not-exploited-zerocoin.png 474w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We are going to continue monitoring the progress and once Pivx commits the changes for releasing the old V2 Zerocoin protocol funds, we will apply the same fix to release any funds currently locked within Zerocoin maintenance mode. As always, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to hop in our discord channel for immediate assistance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Bot Development Progress</u></strong></p>
<p>Our discord bots have gone through quite a bit of redevelopment and are nearing completion.  Over <strong>2000+</strong> lines of code have been changed/added to the codebase.  This includes not just the modifications required to harness the power of the new API wrapper library, but also to expand the feature sets available.</p>
<p>Copbot specifically had upgrades done to its scanning routine, administrative management, and scammer investigation.  Copbot also saw deployment at three new projects recently with Phore, Kalkulus, and Scrypta all requesting the Copbot’s presence protecting their servers from scammers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/copbots.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-505 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/copbots-300x161.png" alt="" width="300" height="161" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/copbots-300x161.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/copbots.png 507w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Tipbot has not only had upgrades to the API library put in, but also the addition of several new account features.  We are currently in the testing phase; however initial reports are very positive.  <strong>Stay tuned for an official release date!  Make sure you turn your umbrellas upside down because of course we will be hosting a celebration party with lots of rain!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/tipbot-help.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-506 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/tipbot-help-187x300.png" alt="" width="187" height="300" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/tipbot-help-187x300.png 187w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/tipbot-help.png 359w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Can you spot some of the new functions?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/twitter-tipbot.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-503 size-medium" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/twitter-tipbot-300x108.png" alt="" width="300" height="108" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/twitter-tipbot-300x108.png 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/twitter-tipbot.png 648w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Can you tell where Tipbot is arriving next?</p>
<p><strong><u>Marketing Updates</u></strong></p>
<p>This year we said goodbye to Tobias (Velk), as he has left Rupaya to focus on his personal business and has no longer available time to dedicate to this project.  In his absence Kevin and Aasim have stepped in to fill the void created and we appreciate the community’s patience as we setup the operational processes to allow for us to jointly manage this function.  All of the social network platforms have been transitioned and are now under our control (we are still waiting for a lock on the telegram server to be released, however we do have access to the account).</p>
<p>After vetting a variety of recruitment options, we identified several community members that each held a skill essential to the marketing process.  Those individuals will be working on a contract basis to provide the requisite marketing materials used for our campaign promotions.  There are individuals with whom we feel would be great assets to the marketing team, however the cost to have them on the team full-time is beyond our reach at this current moment.</p>
<p><strong>What work or materials has been done so far…?</strong></p>
<p>We have commissioned a sixty second promotional video that explains the mission and purpose behind the Rupaya Project.  This video has been completed and will be released later this weekend.  We look forward to having more informational and educational videos produced as the Rupaya ecosystem grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Join us in our discord server this weekend to celebrate the release of the new video!</strong></p>
<p>Other commissioned work includes a series of graphics that will be used for advocacy and general promotion.</p>
<p>Our listing with MasterNodesPro (MNP) has been renewed for the year!  They have established themselves as the #1 resource for masternode statistical information (#1 Alexa Rank!). We look forward to growing our relationship with MNP even further during the upcoming months!</p>
<p>We have also setup a Lifetime listing with Masternodes.Live (MNL)! Project page just went live the other day, excited to see all the stats once they are fully synced up.  Give them a little time to make sure all the information is just right.</p>
<p><strong>What is coming next?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently exploring two large promotional campaigns with separate service providers; however, we cannot share more at this time, as the details are still being worked out.  Stay tuned!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Service Provider Certification Program</u></strong></p>
<p>Lastly, we have kicked our Service Provider Certification program!  This program will be reviewing, cataloging, and scoring all currently known Rupaya Service Providers.  These results will be compiled by the team and released to the entire crypto community in a special press release.  The features and functionality essential to hosting a secure environment and providing full value to our users for their investments will be the cornerstones of our certification program.  An example of a feature we will be looking for would be access to your private keys.  Other feature examples could be two-factor authentication or something as simple as real time support (Discord, telegram).  We are going to use this program to encourage better relationships and features from our service providers, as well as provide our community with reputable feedback regarding the service providers offerings.</p>
<p><strong><u>About Rupaya</u></strong></p>

			<p><strong>TL;DR – RupeeEvolution is not partnered by Rupaya in any way and we strongly advise our community to avoid this project and their proposed swap.</strong></p>
<p>RupeeEvolution is a new cryptocurrency project started initially by disgruntled members of the Rupee Blockchain project. A few of them approached Mobay (Aasim), Velk (Tobias – former team member), and I (TooShameless, Kevin) with the proposition of merging all the South Asia specific projects together under one name.  After a long series of questioning we had concluded that no solid plan outside of “unite together” was available.  We are not the only project that they spoke to who came to this same conclusion.  To add to the problem, Rupee Blockchain, to whom our Founder (Mobay) has spent a long time combating, wanted control over the Rupaya community.  We feel that we possess the better technology and team to support the mission of bringing the digital currency marketplace to the unbanked in South Asia. They must believe we have the better technology as well since they have forked the Rupaya Core wallet and branded it as their own.</p>
<p>The RupeeEvolution team assert that they will provide solutions that don&#8217;t exist and potentially couldn&#8217;t exist from current projects.  Examining in closer detail we find this to be absurdly false.  Thus far their achievement is building a woocommerce store and implementing the woocommerce-altcoin-payment-gateway plugin to accept RUP (plugin found here https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-altcoin-payment-gateway/).  This is an implementation that anyone in the community with desire to setup a retail/service marketplace within woocommerce could achieve utilizing the existing Rupaya system.  Other aspects of their project have yet to see realization.</p>
<p>They have premined approximately 38 MILLION coins to facilitate a series of swaps they will be offering to the Rupee community, Rupaya community, as well as a few others.  This poses a threat to our community and others as they intend to build their team capital with the sale of swapped funds from participating parties.  What that means is they will be taking RUP and RUPX from the community, and then selling them on the market to build their BTC buckets.  All the while preventing swappers from doing anything with their new RupeeEvolution coins as those will not be available to trade on the market for some time.  This funding model does not align with their stance that they “support” these projects, it’s much more akin to “parasitizing” our projects.</p>
<p>By no means is this project endorsed or supported by the Rupaya Core Team.  Our current official stance is to warn our community of this project along with the potential repercussions of their project’s strategy.</p>

			<p>Greetings fellow Rupayans,</p>
<p>It is extremely unfortunate however, today we must deliver the news that Tobias Roediger (most of you know him as Velk) will no longer be a member of the Rupaya core team. In response to the lack of communication to the community, we had enacted a policy back in October 2018 of mandatory communication within the team. We recognize that this is a grassroots project and team members may have other responsibilities that conflict with our schedule. To work around this we believe that consistent communication of our schedules is paramount to effectively working as a small team.</p>
<p>After two weeks without contact from Tobias, we began to worry for Velk&#8217;s whereabouts. At that point we reached out to him across all platforms that we could access him through. We received communication back from Velk, apologizing for the dissappearance but citing personal issues with his business that is requiring all the additional free time that he has. Subsequently he has informed us that he needs to walk away from the Rupaya project and focus on soley his business.</p>
<p>We hope that one day Velk finds his way back to actively participating in the Rupaya community but for now we must say goodbye. We want to thank Velk for all of his hard work, committment, and efforts in helping bring Rupaya to the level it&#8217;s at today. We wish him all the best for him and his company going forward.</p>
<p>In the wake of his absence, Aasim (Mobay) and myself (Kevin, tooshameless) will take over the messaging platforms and community communication responsibilities until such point as we locate a trustworthy and capable replacement. There are numerous activities as part of the transition including account owners, points of contact, as well as the transfer of the marketing budget. Please be patient with us as we solidify the new communication workflow and build the marketing group Rupaya needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governor of Rupaya</p>

			<p>Greetings Rupayans,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a brief summary on the recent problems we’ve all been facing with the wallet.</p>
<p>When the team forked the latest PIVX codebase we faced issues with the zerocoin protocol as Pivx introduced the zerocoin v2 protocol which enabled the staking of zerocoins. We hired Martin to help us fork the codebase and the zerocoin v2 was implemented from genesis, Martin removed variables from the original Pivx codebase that were used to transition from zerocoin v1 to zerocoin v2.</p>
<p>Recently a security exploit (fake stake) was discovered by<a href="https://medium.com/@dsl_uiuc/fake-stake-attacks-on-chain-based-proof-of-stake-cryptocurrencies-b8b05723f806"> Decentralised System Lab @ UIUC</a>, numerous fixes were released by other teams but we decided to wait and see if PIVX would release its own fix which they did <a href="https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/pull/803">PR803</a>, We quickly scrambled to apply the fix to our codebase once implemented we realized that some variables were removed from our codebase resulting the wallet to crash randomly when it discovered that a fake stake was submitted to the blockchain. After numerous hours spent we discovered what was wrong and a fix has been released in wallet version <a href="https://github.com/rupaya-project/rupx/releases/tag/v5.2.0">5.2</a>.</p>
<p>We are thankful to the PIVX Team for promptly fixing the issue and all credit goes to them.</p>
<p>We’ve added a couple of new features from upstream the most notable ones are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pivx.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zerocoin_Light_Node_Protocol.pdf">The Zerocoin Light Node Protocol</a> credits to Matias Furszyfer</li>
<li>A new governance tab has been added to make things look clearer and ease the process to vote on proposals</li>
<li><a href="https://snapcraft.io/rupaya">Snapcraft</a> builds have been implemented (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager)">learn more about snapcraft here</a>)</li>
<li>Numerous other improvements have been committed to (core features, build system, p2p, network, GUI, and the wallet code)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to iron out our shortcomings in the next release and will endeavor to provide a full list of changes made on future releases.</p>
<p>The Rupaya team is committed to the constant betterment and development of our code.  We would like to thank our community for being patient and understanding while they faced constant wallet crashes and constant update requests.</p>

			<p>Evening Rupayan Community,</p>
<p>First of all we would like to apologize for not releasing community updates in a regular and timely fashion for a long time now. We know that an essential component to our success is to keep open and fair communication channels with the community consistent. Unfortunately we have to admit that we have been too sparing with this issue lately and the whole team apologizes for this!</p>
<p>In order to avoid this error going forward the team decided to advertise a position as Community Update Manager to keep the community up to date with the latest information about the state of Rupaya.</p>
<p>For this we have offered the position to Rohin (Rupx Armadillo), who graciously accepted, and we should all welcome him to the core team. Rohin has been a long time active community member with a dedication to the success of the project and mission.  He has decided to give up his earnings related to this position to the community in the form of Tips and Raffle Seeds.</p>
<p>Currently we were discussing within the team how we could organize a Q&amp;A evening for the community. We would like to ask for questions from the community and introduce the team, in a further effort to make the project as transparent as possible.</p>
<p>The Rupaya team recognizes that the community would like to see more and more developments regarding the project.  Since we are a small team at the core we have decided to post various recruitment opportunities for the community to join us in helping accelerate the visibility, accessibility, and usability of Rupaya. People from various fields such as graphic design and content creation have already registered and we want to thank you for the immediate response! The lists are compiled as as each initiative begins we will be reaching out to those that responded.  All positions are currently still open and we will continue to expand as possible. Please do not hesitate to submit your application today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Bot Development:</u></strong></p>
<p>Development work for our various Discord bots took a brief hiatus in January as Shameless (Kevin) and Gwal (Gregory) had outside commitments take priority.  Development has resumed, and new features are being worked on to provide our users with ease of use, better security and in general, a more satisfying user experience. Did someone say QR codes and two factor authentication? These features will be put through thorough testing before they are implemented into the TipBot but they are planned to be released in the near future!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Wallet releases:</u></strong><br />
Rupaya released a new wallet update with a built-in governance proposal tab and many more small tweaks and new features. This wallet also has a fix for the POS (Proof-Of-Stake) Fake Stake vulnerability which was discovered in the majority of POS coins this year. One of the most popular decentralized exchanges, CryptoBridge closed withdrawals and deposits for a large number of coins believed to have the vulnerability in the chain ( <u><a href="https://crypto-bridge.org/2019/01/24/deposit-and-withdrawal-precautions-fake-stake-vulnerability/">https://crypto-bridge.org/2019/01/24/deposit-and-withdrawal-precautions-fake-stake-vulnerability/</a></u> ). Rupaya was not identified as being affected, however we still have made the necessary patches in the latest update to fully ensure all funds stay safe and secure.</p>
<p>We know that it currently takes a lot of time to update the frequent wallet releases but we can assure you that this is only in the interest of the project. As so often it comes to smaller problems in the development of new technology but we can assure you that the team will always do its best to fix problems as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Explorer updates:</u></strong><br />
Our main explorer find.rupx.io has been given a complete makeover for a sleeker new look and better user experience. Address claiming is one of the new features that has been added to the explorer. A new iquidus explorer has also been launched after a discrepancy with MnZone which led to the dissolution of our partnership with them. This means that rupx.mn.zone is no longer a service provider to Rupaya and should not be used for any Rupaya related network information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>New exchange listings:</u></strong></p>
<p>Rupaya has been listed on the newly re-launched Nova Exchange with BTC and DOGE pairs. The addition of this exchange will help Rupaya in increasing our daily volume as well as attracting more people who will join us in our cause for a better and advanced financial system for South Asia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Documentation Portal</u></strong></p>
<p>The Rupaya documentation Portal, <u><a href="https://docs.rupx.io">https://docs.rupx.io</a></u> ,  provides easy to follow manuals to our users for setting up their masternodes as well as information on many different Rupaya related topics. The documentation portal goes through continuous update to make sure all information there is 100% up to date.  If you wish to contribute to the Documentation library, please contact one of the core team members to get the ball rolling.</p>

<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
<h3>Blockfolio Signals Status</h3>
<p>An important component of user awareness, tools like Blockfolio Signals gives us the ability to reach people interested or invested in Rupaya with timely news and information.</p>
<p>On Monday of this week we went through the Blockfolio Signals onboarding call. We are now just waiting on the activation of our account and hope to have full access to our dashboard yet this week. Once that final step happens we can begin posting updates to Blockfolio Signals, something we&#8217;ve been eagerly looking forward to since the announcement of the program.</p>
<h3>Email Newsletter</h3>
<p>Beginning today the Rupaya newsletter will start going out with an overview of this update. This is just one more way you can stay up to date with project news and information.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this edition of the Community Update we will cover general news, Discord bot upgrades, the coin swap extension program, core development progress, marketing updates, and much more.</p>
<h2>Project Development Updates</h2>
<h3>The Bots are Coming Back to Town</h3>
<p>After the resounding success of the Rupaya CoinSwap Bot, we are launching several new and improved bots. TipBot and RaffleBot as well as an all new PoliceBot to prevent Discord fraudsters will be coming to the Rupaya Discord server this week.</p>
<p>These bots have gone through a complete overhaul (over 2,000 lines of code changed) taking them from the old python library to the new rewrite. What kinds of new features can you expect? Here’s a real quick rundown.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Currency Conversion</strong> — The new tipbot comes with the ability to calculate conversion of rupx to fiat equivalent. This means that you can ad-hoc check how much RUPX equals a set fiat amount, or you can also set your default fiat so that all of your transactions are also shown with the fiat equivalent value of your choice. These currency rates are updated hourly through an API connection for European Central Banking rates.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>True Transaction Fees on TipBot</strong> — There is no longer a 1 RUPX fee for withdrawals. We check to ensure you have at least .01 more than what you wish to send but then make sure to only reduce the balance by the actual transaction fee cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>You now can tip/rain/withdraw less than 1 RUPX.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Soaks</strong> will only apply to those in the community that have earned the “Soak Worthy” role!</p>
<ul>
<li>Soaks also have a mandatory minimum of 10 RUPX.</li>
<li>You must opt-in initially to receive “soaks” but you also have the option to opt-out if you don’t wish to receive them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You now can purchase raffle tickets directly from your tipbot balance, no more having to transfer and wait to purchase tickets!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> All bots have enhanced backend administrative features as well as enhanced connection reset and error handling.</p>
<h3>Main CoinSwap Completed</h3>
<p>Following the completion of the Rupaya Coin Swap event we wanted to share a couple key, and impressive stats.</p>
<ul>
<li>23,895,690.4202245 Coins swapped through the RUPX Coin Swap Bot</li>
<li>591 swap accounts were created</li>
<li>411 swaps were completed in the first 10 days!</li>
<li>More than a 92% satisfaction rating with our swap process</li>
</ul>
<h3><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Major Coin Swap Update</h3>
<p>Since there were a significant number of people that started but weren’t able to complete their swap within the allotted time, we have decided to open the coin swap bot back up <strong>for one week only</strong>, and <strong>ONLY to those that have already started but not finished their swap.</strong></p>
<p>This means that the SwapBot will have the $start command DISABLED and will ONLY work for those that have already started their swaps but did not complete in time.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>No new swaps will be accepted.</strong> The SwapBot will open back up on November 10, 2018 and be available until 11:59PM UTC November 17, 2017.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you started your swap but are still unable to complete during that week then it is <strong>YOUR RESPONSIBILITY</strong> to reach out to a core team member to see if any special arrangement can be made.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2757.png" alt="❗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>Any swaps not completed by the final date will be added to the coin burn amount. The coin burn will take place at the end of the month once we have had time to reconcile the snapshot balance to the amount that was swapped. With respect to transparency, the coin burn will be recorded and documented for the community to review.</em></p>
<h2>Discord Safety Tip</h2>
<p><em>Here’s a nifty safety tip from the keyboard of team member Kevin (@tooshameless#1337 on Discord).</em></p>
<p>First off, you will need developer mode for this to work.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>Need to know how to enable Discord’s Developer mode? Visit: <a href="https://discordia.me/developer-mode">https://discordia.me/developer-mode</a>.</em></p>
<p>With this mode enabled, you can get the user id with a right click or a push-hold on mobile. You can also get the id by putting a backslash in front of whatever you want the id for. For example, entering:</p>
<p><code>\@tooshameless#1337</code></p>
<p>will return the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;@322163518046732288&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can also use this in reverse. For example if a person has changed their nickname to try and avoid being found or in order to have different names in different servers. In Discord if you enter:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;@322163518046732288&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Then the users current nickname will be returned in the channel.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2757.png" alt="❗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <em>Please keep these methods in mind. They are especially useful when approached via DM by someone claiming to be from the Rupaya team. You will be able to quickly and easily check to see that they are who they say they are.</em></p>
<h2>New Services</h2>
<p>Over the last couple weeks Rupaya has been listed with several new services. Be sure to check them all out and give us a rating where you can!</p>

<h2>Delta Direct Updates</h2>
<p>Rupaya is now live on Delta Direct. All the latest RUPX updates will now be directly available on Delta tracking app.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you use Delta to track your portfolio be sure to enable notifications for our Direct updates within the app so you never miss out on important project news or updates!</p>
<p>We’re very excited about this addition to our notification options and hope that it will bring additional exposure and increased reputation to our project.</p>
<h2>Marketing Overview</h2>
<h3>Rupaya Presentation</h3>
<p>Our marketing lead Tobias (velk#8724 on Discord) recently spoke about Rupaya and our mission to a packed room at the 2018 Digital Crossroads, put on by the Louisville Digital Association in Louisville, KY. The presentation covered an overview of what Rupaya is, our overarching vision, and regional focus.</p>
<p>The majority of the audience was not cryptocurrency savvy. So this was a completely new audience for our project.</p>
<p>Our project got additional shoutouts from two following presenters who were impressed with the initial presentation and what we are developing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-331" src="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation.jpg" alt="Rupaya 2018 LDA Conference Presentation" width="1200" height="832" srcset="https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation.jpg 1200w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation-300x208.jpg 300w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation-768x532.jpg 768w, https://rupx.io/wp-content/uploads/rupaya-2018-lda-conference-presentation-1024x710.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
